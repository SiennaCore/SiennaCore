Who was I, and who will I be?üWó<Ò©¡XÔYou were a shadow in the night, hated and feared by all. Your swords and daggers spoke in whispers, but dealt death all the same.

You will be a methodical killer, prowling in the shadows to unleash demoralizing attacks. You will imbue your dual blades with fire and death and hurl them at enemies too cowardly to face you.

Your powers over fire and death will disorient, silence, and snare those who oppose you. You will take shelter in the shadows, protecting you from assault, and when they try to overwhelm you with numbers, you will release jets of flame to incinerate them where they stand.

You will be unstoppable.ﬂŒ¨Ãéó€
