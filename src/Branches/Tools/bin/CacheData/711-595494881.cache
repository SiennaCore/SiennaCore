0¯You were an artisan reviled for your use of death magic, but your destructive power proved that darkness can serve the light.

You will be a nightmare, bending the forces of corruption to overcome evil. Tendrils of death will erupt from your fingertips and slowly eat away at your foes. When you are injured, you will leech their life to replenish your own.

Your dark magic will silence and stun your enemies as it corrodes and steals their armor. So confident in your measure of mortality, you will tap into your own life force to power your horrific attacks. As you spread death to the enemy hordes, they will flee in horror at the sight of your grisly works.

You will be terrifying.ßÆðž¶—Û
