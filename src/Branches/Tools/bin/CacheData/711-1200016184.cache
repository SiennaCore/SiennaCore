%Ç8Ë†GŸWÆW—<Ö?Tell me about Thontic.ŸW—<RÚsêThontic is the sea. He is mystery, he is exploration, and he is the unknown. Travelers, merchants, and adventurers honor him to bless their endeavors, while scholars and mages ask for him to remove the veil of mystery that clouds their minds.  

He favors the bold and adventurous, but punishes the reckless and foolish. Scholars that seek to dispel common falsehoods find themselves in his favor. Those that perpetuate lies feel his wrath.

Thontic is the patron god of traders, sailors and scholars. Covenants with him have been made and broken many times. With whom remains as much a mystery as their significance. J
