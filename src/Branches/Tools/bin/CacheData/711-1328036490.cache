%ÇŠ:(OŸWÆW—<`ùÒAre you the High Priestess?ŸW—<øþÎW‚Before the Shade took me I was a sentinel of the gods. I wished to know the wisdom of the land from Tavril, the love of the heart from Mariel-Taun, the courage of the sword from Thedeor, the community of the city from Bahralt, and mystery of the sea from Thontic. My message helped to unify many people and unite them to defy the tyrant king.

The gods of the Vigil brought me back and bade me continue to spread their message to all of Telara. I have taken the title of Pentarch to represent my allegiance to the five who are one. I help to guide the clergy of the Vigil and teach the other Guardians the meaning of the miracle of ascension.J
