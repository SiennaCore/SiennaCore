%@!WW<׸fWhat happened to the dwarves?W<|The cities of the dwarves have fallen. Lord's Hall has shut its doors and is assaulted by creatures of the planes while Hammerknell fell to corruption from within. Our people are scattered, our culture lost.

When the Shade came to our great delves we had thought ourselves safe, what army or magic could breach our walls? Then our great advances in crafting turned on us. Demons broke free from the bindings that forced them to toil within our machines. Our whole society was built upon evil. That most of us were unaware of this is small comfort, we have paid with the best of us.

For now Sanctum will be our home. Our people will grow strong as we will rebuild the world side by side with the gods. This is how it should be. This was how we started as a people. Together with the Guardians we will redeem Telara and create a new golden age.J
