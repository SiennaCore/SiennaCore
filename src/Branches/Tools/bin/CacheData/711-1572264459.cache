%ÇÚ¶]ŸWÆW—<µº=Tell me about Mariel-Taun.ŸW—<ÓwÔ`ËMariel-Taun is the heart of the Vigil. She is compassion, she is love, she is fellowship, and she is creativity and beauty. In the hearts of mortals she stirs selfless acts of kindness and empathy. To those that honor her and follow the path of the heart she grants wisdom, beauty and fortune. To those who are selfish and cruel she leaves a hole that may never be filled.

Her blessings are for those that act for the good of all, to bring beauty into this world.  She commands her followers to make art of beauty and meaning, to inspire others to acts of good and wonder. 

She is the patron of healers, artists, and lovers. All people welcome her attention and long for her blessings. She has made no covenant until the coming of the Vigil. Her compassion and love for you is what brought you back from death at the hands of the destroyer. J
