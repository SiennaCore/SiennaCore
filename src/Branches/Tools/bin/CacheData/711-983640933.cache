tWho was I, and who will I be?ŸW—<¢!áÆYou were a stalwart defender, bolstering friends as you battered foes. You raised your shield and stepped into the darkness, banishing evil with holy light.

You will be a lightbringer, charging into battle with sword, shield and your inborn brilliance. Enemies will focus their attacks on you instead of your allies, but they will find that your shield reflects damage with each shattering block.

Your defenses will make you near indestructible. While absorbing damage meant for allies, you will disarm and stun foes with thrown hammers. And if the battle ever seems hopeless, you will heal yourself to full, resurrect fallen allies, and stun the enemy ranks with your mighty cleaves.

You will be righteous.ßÐÙîN—Û
