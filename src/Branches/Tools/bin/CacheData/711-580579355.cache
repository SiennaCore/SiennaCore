Tavril is the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. She is the hunt of the predator, and the safety of the herd. She is the beauty of nature, and the danger of the wilderness. Tavril is nature itself.

The hunter and the farmer give thanks to Tavril for what they take from her. The traveler fears her wrath and treads lightly across her domain. Those that find communion will find the balance and harmony that she offers, she is freedom. 

Tavril is the patron of the High Elves, who have walked with her in harmony since time began. The breaking of this covenant will herald the waking of the dragons, the coming of the blood storm, and will reveal the prophecy of the end of times. J
