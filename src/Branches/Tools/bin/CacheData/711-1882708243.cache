You will be an elemental fury, imbuing your weapons with wind and lightning to inflict great damage face-to-face with your foe. Your vengeance will give you great power, and you will keep it stoked for the perfect strike.

Your elemental prowess will give courage to your allies, snare enemies, heal your wounds, and grant you an icy shield that punishes those who attack you. And when your enemies flee, you will charge across the battlefield, pin them down, and end their lives with your thunderous strikes.

You will be brutal.ﬂ˛óôÈ	ó€
