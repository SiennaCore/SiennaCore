You will be a firestorm that incinerates all in your path. From steadfast hands, you will hurl molten rock at foes and unleash terrifying conflagrations that will burn whole armies.

Your devastating flames will surround and trap your foes, stunning them with the speed of their demise. When you are surrounded, you will scorch the earth itself and cause foes to drop their weapons. You will emerge from the flames empowered by the inferno, but your enemies will be ash at your feet.
