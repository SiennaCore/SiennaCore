ÙBüW∆Wó< Õ(9Tell me about Thedeor.üWó<ÕíìThedeor is the sword. Thedeor is combat, warfare and the battlefield. He is struggle, duty, and the glory of triumphing over adversity. All who go into battle venerate him, for glorious, honorable victory is his praise.  

Thedeor despises the despot, the bully, and the oppressor as well as the coward, the cheat or those that seek victory through craven means. Stand forth and meet your enemies openly and honorably and he will bless you with victory.

Thedeor is the patron deity of the Mathosian people. In them he has placed his strength and resolve. But all people who fight for a just cause can call upon him for strength. This covenant was broken by the Tyrant Aedraxis Mathos, who turned from the gods and brought the rifts to Telara with the heretical machines of the Defiants.J
