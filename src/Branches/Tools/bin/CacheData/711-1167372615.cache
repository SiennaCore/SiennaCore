You will be a harbinger of death, harnessing dark magic to defend allies and destroy foes. You will leech life to heal your wounds and spread disease to pull foes from your allies. You will inspire terror in those who witness your sinister acts.

Your defenses will make you an unstoppable, grisly pestilence. You will summon mists of death to corrode and ensnare foes, and when the hordes rise up against you, the festering wounds you've inflicted will explode and obliterate them all.

You will be inexhaustible.ß€Ð·È—Û
