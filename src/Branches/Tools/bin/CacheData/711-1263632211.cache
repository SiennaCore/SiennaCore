You will be a whirlwind of destruction, decimating your enemies with two-handed weapons. You will shift your bearings at whim and use the damage you take to fuel furious retaliatory strikes. You will ignore defense, preferring to kill your foes before they kill you.

Your terrifying assaults will stun, snare, and scatter the enemy in fear. You will charge into the fray and kick down those who remain standing. The wounds you inflict will be long in healing, but it will not matter, for your relentless blows will finish them off.

You will be ruthless.ßŽÀÚÜ—Û
