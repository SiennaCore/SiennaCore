%6LWW<m2Tell me about Bahralt.W<gBahralt is the city. Bahralt is community, industry, and empire. When mortals come out of the wilderness and work together they honor Bahralt.  The tiny hamlet honors him with a shrine, the mighty city with a sprawling cathedral. Bahralt is culture, and how a society worships him speaks to the soul of the people.

Bahralt is the craftsman of the gods of the Vigil, and the teacher of mortals. From him the arts of metalworking, woodworking, and alchemy were discovered. He inspires mortals to work together towards a common goal, and teaches them the rules for a harmonious society. 

Bahralt is the patron of the dwarven people. In them he has placed the industriousness and resolve to construct the greatest cities on Telara. This covenant was broken by King Molinar of Hammerknell, who forged the spirits of Regulos into his city to reap rewards beyond his skill. His people are now scattered and without a home.
