%ÇK;²VŸWÆW—<ö0×nWho was I, and who will I be?ŸW—<2bŽlÌYou were a master of planar energies, coalescing the elements to imprison and shatter those who stood against you.

You will be a tempest, unleashing elemental storms of water, fire, earth, and air. Your power will be so great that you will bind the elements themselves into minions that will besiege foes at your command.

Your arcane magic will return mana, shield you from damage, and knockback and snare your enemies. Those still standing may get through your barrier, but you will sacrifice your minions to heal and summon elemental swarms to finish them off.

You will be brilliant.ßúâ–ÿ—Û
