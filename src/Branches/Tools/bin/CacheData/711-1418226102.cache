%Ç¶iˆTŸWÆW—<Aa±MWho was I, and who will I be?ŸW—<Å1þYou were a cleric unsatisfied with the healing arts. You relinquished the power of restoration so that you could punish the wicked, and evil soon knew your name.

You will be a harsh judge, smiting the corrupt with the energies of life and death. You will unleash punishing bolts from great range, and your righteous reprisal will steal life and mana from your foes.

Your powers over life and death will snare, knock back, and horrify the impure, while your shining example will bolster allies against fear. When the depraved hordes circle round, you will drain their very souls and reduce them to lifeless husks.

You will be merciless.ßš‹¯—Û
