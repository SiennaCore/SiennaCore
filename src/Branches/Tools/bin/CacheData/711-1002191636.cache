The dwarves have long guarded this dread relic of the Destroyer. Like the Fang, its mere presence changes a land. Truth be told I sleep better at night knowing I'm not near the thing.

But now it seems we are called upon to make use of it. Take this key. When you enter the Breach Room this will open the Vault of Secrets and you will have to defeat whatever phantoms the heart of evil tries to assault you with. Then bath this holy sword in the ichor. Then you'll have an instrument that can truly end the dragon of life.ßŒ¢¶Ÿ—ÛßŽ½¯ì²™‹ÞÚ†‡€
