%fZWW<sWhat has happened to Mathosia?W<pOMy beloved country is no more. While you defeated Regulos, and we were victorious, my beloved country was a casualty of that battle. They call the heart of the kingdom Stillmoor now, a necrotic land with little of the beauty it once had. I led the Ascended and as many survivors as I could to safety in the city of Port Scion, until it too fell to the rifts. Sanctum is now our home, where we will take back our lands from the monsters and the machine born.

But the people of Mathosia endure. These lands were all once part of the kingdom. We have our shared culture, and our friends the dwarves and elves who have also suffered since the rifts. Adversity creates a bond between people. The gods of the Vigil have shown me we will be victorious in this.J
